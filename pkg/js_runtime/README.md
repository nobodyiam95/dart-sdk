# Package `js_runtime`:

This package contains code that is shared between the dart2js compiler and the
dart2js runtime libraries.

*Important*: all code under the `lib/synced/` must be kept in sync with the
runtime at all times (in `sdk/lib/_internal/js_runtime/lib/synced`). The
`test/in_sync_test.dart` test verifies this.
